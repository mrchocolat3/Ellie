Last night I had a dream
And It was beautiful than anything 
O Last thing I remember is that 
I was holding you while you were crying 

From the very beginning I didn't like you
Now I wanna see you again and I want you
and I wanna tell you that I will never leave you 
and I'll always be there standing beside you

oh I remember that you were crying
You looked lovely and ICame running
To you to stop you as it was hurting me I
loved you at that moment when you were cryin eh

And It was a dream 
Where I saw her crying 
I didn't like that 
I want her back
