# Ellie <b> v0.1.5 </b>

To see the `lates updates` on this version, Goto `Lib > Log > Updates` and open `Updates` with your favourite `IDE`

There are many **Graphical User Interfaces** made with different `modules`. Right now the working gui is in `EllieUi.py` file. So run **`EllieUi.py`** and you should be good.

# **Required Modules** to Install

* **ffmpeg**

* **fb-chat**

* **kivy**

* **moviepy**

* **open cv**

* **pytube**

* **pygame**

* **pyttsx3**

* **speech_recognition**

* **wikipedia**

--------------------------------------------------

**Note: There is folder called Settings which contains a key named `talk`. Turn it to `False` if you are running in Gui Mode `(EllieUi.py)` because idk why kivy stops working after saying the reply out loud. Set it to`True` if you are running on Console mode `(Ellie.py)` for some fun :)**
